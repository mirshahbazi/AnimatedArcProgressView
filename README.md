# AnimatedArcProgressView
This is an animated progress view that is capable of several animation types for animating indefinite progress.

So far it's being under development, so it's not yet a library. But keep tuned, it's gonna be cool :)


Please take a look at a video of a demo app which I made to show some possibilities that this view provides to fellow developers:
